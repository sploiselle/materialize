### Kafka source details

- Materialize expects each source to use one Kafka topic, which is&mdash;in
  turn&mdash;generated by a single table in an upstream database.
- {{ if eq ($.Get "format") "avro" }}By default, Materialize only ingests message payloads, not their keys.
  Avro-formatted sources, though, can work with message keys using the
  [**Upsert envelope**](#upsert-envelope-details).
- {{ end }}Materialize supports connecting to SSL-encrypted or Kerberized Kafka clusters.

#### SSL-encrypted Kafka details

Enable connections to SSL-encrypted Kafka clusters using the appropriate [`WITH` options](#ssl-with-options).

- Create encrypted connections to a Kafka cluster by providing a copy of the CA
  certificate that signed the Kafka broker's certificate (`ssl_ca_location`).
- Connect to SSL authenticated clusters by providing an SSL certificate, key, and
  optional password (`ssl_certificate_location`, `ssl_key_location`,
  `ssl_key_password`).
- Materialize can also connect to Confluent Schema
  Registries if they use the same CA as the Kafka broker.

#### Kerberized Kafka details

Enable connections to Kerberized Kafka clusters using the appropriate [`WITH`
options](#kerberos-with-options).

**Note:** Materialize cannot yet use Kerberos authentication to connect to
Confluent Schema Registries.
